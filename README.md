# Maps Lab

In this lab, complete the four functions with `TODO` comments. The comments for each function describe what the function should do. When you are finished, upload two things to Canvas:
1. a copy of your MapsLab.java, and
2. a results.txt file (where you have copied the output of your program).

Happy mapping!
